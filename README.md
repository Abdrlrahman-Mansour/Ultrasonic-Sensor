# Ultrasonic-Sensor
An ultrasonic sensor is a type of electronic device that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves. It works by emitting a pulse of ultrasonic sound, which travels through the air and reflects off an object. The sensor then receives the reflected sound wave and calculates the distance based on the time it takes for the sound to travel to the object and back.

## GET STARTED
To get started with this project, follow the steps below to set up your environment and begin using the ultrasonic sensor.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Hardware:**
  - Ultrasonic sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
  - Microcontroller (e.g., PIC18F4620 or other compatible MCU)
  - Breadboard and jumper wires
  - Power supply (e.g., 5V for the sensor)
  - LCD (To display the Distance)
  - Any additional components as specified in the project

- **Software:**
  - Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for programming the microcontroller (e.g., MPLAB X IDE)
  - Proteus 8.9 Professional
  - Microcontroller firmware (provided in this repository)
  - Serial communication software (e.g., PuTTY) for data monitoring (if applicable)

#### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdrlrahman-Mansour/Ultrasonic-Sensor.git
   cd Ultrasonic-Sensor
2. **Set Up Hardware:**
- Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the microcontroller according to the wiring diagram provided in the repository.
- Ensure all connections are secure and power is supplied correctly.

3. **Programming the Microcontroller:**
- Open the project in your IDE (MPLAB X IDE or other compatible software).
- Compile the firmware and upload it to the microcontroller.

4. **Running the Project:**
- Once the firmware is uploaded, power on the circuit.
- If the project includes data monitoring, open the serial communication software and connect to the appropriate COM port.


5. **Testing:**
- Test the setup by placing objects at various distances from the ultrasonic sensor.
- Verify that the sensor outputs accurate distance measurements.
